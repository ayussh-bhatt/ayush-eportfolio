    <h2>Communication Skills Improvement</h2>
    <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Mrs. Anubha</p>
    <p>During this course, I learned how to present ideas confidently, understand the importance of body language and tone, and communicate effectively in both personal and professional settings. We practiced active listening, professional writing, and participated in mock interviews and group discussions. These exercises significantly enhanced my fluency, confidence, and interpersonal abilities.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Anubha’s teaching style was highly interactive. Instead of sticking to theory, she introduced practical, real-world activities like role-playing, debate sessions, and live presentations. These activities not only made the sessions engaging but also helped in reinforcing our communication habits and leadership skills. Her knowledge and experience in the field of communication were evident, and she always provided personalized feedback that helped me grow.</p>
    <p>Thanks to her mentorship, I am now more comfortable expressing myself clearly in different settings — be it public speaking, teamwork, or interviews. This course has played a significant role in shaping my professional persona.</p>
